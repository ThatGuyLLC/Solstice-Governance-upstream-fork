## 2.1 Governance Tiers and Safes

Solstice governance is split across two contracts, each operated by a tier composed of two independent organization multisigs (Safes): **Tier 1, the SWA Governance Tier (§2.2)**, and **Tier 2, the SRA Governance Tier (§2.3)**. FIP-0118 fixes the separation and the approval structure:

> "No address in the registry may participate in either contract governance tier, as a governance multisig or as a key holder within one: a party that set weights could raise its own share, and one that ran the registry could admit itself or block competitors."

Governance is a bespoke UnanimousGovernance contract, not a nested Safe. Each entity's Safe handles co-signing. Where the FIP holds a change before it binds (every discretionary SWA write, and a code upgrade at either tier), the hold and the unilateral cancel are the contract's own logic. Nesting Safes solves co-signing, not objection. An SRA registry change has no post-approval hold and no cancel (§2.1.2). For SWA writes the hold is additionally enforced at f02 (`SWA_TIMELOCK`), so it survives a compromised or maliciously upgraded governance contract. How each owner is implemented internally (incl. a nested multisig) is the entity's operational discretion.

### 2.1.1 Standards for a governance Safe (both tiers)

- The organization has a track record in Filecoin governance or engineering, and is independent of the other organization in the same tier.
- Recommended, not protocol-enforced: an internal threshold of at least 2, and hardware key custody.
- No registry address may participate in either governance tier, as a governance multisig or as a key holder within one (FIP-0118 §4.2). The FIP's rule is address-level.
- Repository disclosure, not a change to that rule: each organization states, in this repository, the legal entity that holds its Safe and whether that entity or a signer operates, invests in, or is otherwise affiliated with an Orchestrator. Both Safes of the tier must still approve on chain. `TODO(owners):` publish the entities, and whether an affiliated signer must stand out of that Safe's internal approval. This repository does not waive the two-Safe approval, and it does not set a recusal rule that could leave a Safe unable to sign.
- Internal member rotation is org-internal and immediate; it requires no governance action.

### 2.1.2 Approval and cancellation rules (both tiers)

These rules are fixed by the FIP and restated here for operators.

> FIP-0118, on the change lifecycle (§4.3). Discretionary changes follow two paths, not one:
>
> > "Every discretionary SWA write is published and held, and either multisig can cancel during the hold; there is no exemption by category at that tier, so reducing a weight to zero is held exactly like removing a stream. SRA registry writes bind at once: their protection is the published rationale plus the replaceability of the tier (Sections 3.2 and 4.1), and the one held SRA action is the code upgrade, held for `SRA_UPGRADE_HOLD` (Section 3.2)."

**Mechanism-executed updates** take no approval and are not cancellable. The quarterly gate check and the `SetShares` recompute run permissionlessly through entry points that can emit only the value the mechanism computes; their integrity guard sits upstream in the FPV verification window. The tiers exercise no judgment over these updates because there is no judgment to exercise.

> FIP-0118 on why mechanism writes cannot be canceled (§4.3):
>
> > "Mechanism-executed updates cannot be canceled: the gate's quarterly w2 write queues in f02 under `SWA_TIMELOCK` for visibility, but it arrives through its own method, `StepWeightRecords`, the one operation `CancelPending` refuses (Section 2.4.7), while the SRA's quarterly share map is never queued and binds directly via `SetShares` (Section 3.2)."

**Discretionary changes** are as follows:

- **Approval:** both of the tier's Safes. SWA writes additionally require a published and accepted FIP. Registry changes deliberately carry no per-change FIP requirement; the carve-out covers data within the rules, never code. An upgrade of either contract's code requires a FIP.
- **Cancellation:** SWA discretionary writes are published and held for SWA_TIMELOCK; either Safe alone can cancel during the hold. SRA registry changes bind at once: both Safes approve, the change emits an on-chain event and carries a mandatory published rationale in this repository. The one exception is an SRA code upgrade, which is held before it binds.

### 2.1.3 Summary of changes

Informative summary; the lifecycle table in the FIP is normative.

| Action | Hold | Enforced by | Cancellable by |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Discretionary SWA write to f02 (alter, add, or remove a stream; re-point a Distribution) | `SWA_TIMELOCK`, 7 days (FIP-fixed) | f02 | Either SWA Safe |
| SWA internal change (gate parameters, code upgrade) | Internal timelock, equal to the f02 window (FIP-fixed) | SWA | Either SWA Safe via `veto(taskId)` |
| Cooperative Safe replacement (`ReplaceOwner`) | None; binds at once | SWA or SRA | Not cancellable |
| Quarterly gate step | 7-day queue, visibility only | f02 | No one (mechanism-executed) |
| Registry change (add/remove orchestrator, replace wallet, set admitted lists, set pricing, replace owner) | None; binds at once | SRA | Not cancellable |
| Registry / code upgrade | Requires an approved FIP; held for `SRA_UPGRADE_HOLD` (20,160 epochs / 7 days) before it binds | SRA | Either SRA Safe via `veto(taskId)` during the hold |
| CorrectVolume | None; bounded by the verification window | SRA | Not cancellable |
| SetShares, PostVolume, RegisterPairs | None; bounded by the window, the posting period, and the uniqueness check | SRA | Not cancellable |

> FIP-0118 fixes the `SWA_TIMELOCK` hold in L1:
>
> > "f02 itself holds every SWA write for `SWA_TIMELOCK` (7 days, Section 2.4) before applying it, so even a compromised multisig or a maliciously upgraded SWA cannot make a change bind early."

The full compromise and rotation procedures for both tiers are in §2.5, Safety and rotation playbook.

## 2.2 SWA Governance Tier — Tasks and Actions

> **How to read this subsection:** every individual action below is a collapsible dropdown. Click an action's title to expand only the one you care about.

SWA Governance is **Tier 1**: it governs the Stream Weights Actor (SWA) — the list of streams and the split among them. FIP-0118 fixes its discretionary powers, each of which additionally requires a published FIP:

> SWA Governance discretionary powers (FIP-0118): *"add a stream (RegisterStream) or remove one (RemoveStream)"*, *"alter a stream: rewrite its Weight record (SetWeightRecords) or re-route its Distribution"*, *"tune the gate parameters (SetGateParams)"*, and *"upgrade the SWA's code"*.

SWA Governance approves nothing routine: the w1 ramp and the volume gate are mechanism-executed. Every discretionary action writes to f02, requires a published and accepted FIP first, and is held for `SWA_TIMELOCK` (7 days) before it binds.

- **During every `SWA_TIMELOCK`:** monitor the f02 queue and the off-chain objection process, and act on a sustained objection within the expected response-time commitment of 7 days.
- **Per discretionary write:** confirm the backing FIP is published and accepted before approval, and verify the schedule envelope (the sum of weights at most 1 across the whole segment) before submission.
- **Continuous:** keep Safe rosters and internal-implementation disclosures in this repository current.

> **Standard SWA discretionary-write flow** (referenced by 2.2.1–2.2.4):
>
> 1. Draft the exact write and carry a FIP through to 'Accepted' (including Last Call). No write is submitted without an accepted FIP.
> 2. Pre-submission check: verify the schedule envelope (Σw ≤ 1 across the whole segment) and that the write matches the accepted FIP.
> 3. Both SWA Safes approve `ProposeWrite(write)`. The first Safe’s transaction only records its approval (`UnanimousGovernance`); the action body runs in the second Safe’s transaction. The second Safe signs only if a dry-run simulation of **its own** approval succeeds, and notes the simulation result on the task-register issue. On a simulated revert, either Safe `veto`s and the action is resubmitted (a failed second approval leaves the task half-approved and burns the signature round).
> 4. The SWA relays to f02; f02 queues it with an `effective_epoch` and holds it for `SWA_TIMELOCK` (7 days).
> 5. Objection window: the queued write is public. Monitor objections filed under [§2.2.8](#228--objection-during-an-swa-hold). Either SWA Safe may `cancelPending` / `cancelPendingWeight` / `veto(taskId)` (as applies) on a mismatch with the accepted FIP, a missing FIP, or new information that surfaced after acceptance. Absent a cancellation it binds at `effective_epoch`. `TODO(owners): confirm` that a veto or a cancellation is recorded on the task-register issue with a written reason. The contract does not require the reason.
> 6. Record the outcome in this repository and in the [Program Change Log](06-changelog.md).

The L1 envelope check restates a FIP invariant:

> "the projected weights must satisfy `Σ_{i>=1} w_i(e) <= 1` at every epoch from the write's effective epoch onward, so the burn residual w0 stays non-negative."

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.1 — Alter a stream: rewrite a Weight record (SetWeightRecords)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SWA Safes + accepted FIP · **Hold:** `SWA_TIMELOCK`, 7 days · **Enforced by:** f02 · **Cancel:** either SWA Safe

Standard flow above; the call is `SetWeightRecords`. Reducing a weight to zero is held exactly like removing the stream. A discretionary write that changes the w2 Weight record must be paired with the matching `steps` adjustment via `SetGateParams` (see §2.2.5 for sequencing and recovery).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.2 — Add a stream (RegisterStream)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SWA Safes + accepted FIP · **Hold:** `SWA_TIMELOCK`, 7 days · **Enforced by:** f02 · **Cancel:** either SWA Safe

Standard flow; the call is `RegisterStream(id, weight_record, distribution, activation_epoch)`. Step 2 also confirms the stream and recipient caps and that `activation_epoch ≥ current_epoch + SWA_TIMELOCK`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.3 — Remove a stream (RemoveStream)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SWA Safes + accepted FIP · **Hold:** `SWA_TIMELOCK`, 7 days · **Enforced by:** f02 · **Cancel:** either SWA Safe

Standard flow; the call is `RemoveStream(id)`. The removed weight reverts to the burn residual; removal creates no free value.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.4 — Re-point a stream's Distribution (SetDistribution)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SWA Safes + accepted FIP · **Hold:** `SWA_TIMELOCK`, 7 days · **Enforced by:** f02 · **Cancel:** either SWA Safe

Standard flow; the call is `SetDistribution(id, distribution)`. Can be used, for instance, to re-point the service stream's designated writer to a redeployed SRA (such as the SRA-deadlock backstop). The current wallet-to-share map stays in force until the new writer overwrites it, so payments continue across the change.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.5 — Tune the gate parameters (SetGateParams)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SWA Safes + accepted FIP · **Hold:** SWA-internal timelock, 7 days · **Enforced by:** SWA · **Cancel:** either SWA Safe

1. Publish and get an accepted FIP for the new gate parameters (`base`, `stepRatio`, and `steps` — not a free “step size”; the 5pp step itself is a contract constant).
2. Both SWA Safes approve `SetGateParams(params)`. A discretionary write that changes the w2 Weight record must go in the same governance action as the matching `steps` adjustment via `SetGateParams`. Per FIP-0118 §3.1.1, sequence the pair so that no `QuarterlyGateCheck` applies between the two effective epochs; the SWA enforces this only when the two holds overlap. Before approval, the issue records both effective epochs and the next `QuarterlyGateCheck` epoch, and states that no gate check falls between them.
3. The change queues in the SWA's own state under the SWA-internal timelock (7 days). The gate rule itself is code and cannot change via a parameter write. Either Safe may cancel during the hold.
4. If one half of a paired write is cancelled after the other has applied, w2 and `steps` stay mismatched until a new paired write. That re-send is authorized only by an accepted FIP. This repository does not pre-authorize it.
5. Record in this repository.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.6 — Upgrade the SWA's code</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SWA Safes + accepted FIP · **Hold:** SWA-internal timelock, 7 days · **Enforced by:** SWA · **Cancel:** either SWA Safe

Same flow as 2.2.5; the FIP carries the upgrade. It executes through the pre-upgrade code, so the hold and checks still bind. The upgrade issue pins the [solstice upgrade runbook](https://github.com/filecoin-project/solstice/blob/main/docs/UPGRADE.md) by commit. FIP-0118 §4.2 requires that the pending upgrade and its execution be observable on chain. `TODO(owners): confirm` whether the issue must also record an implementation bytecode hash. This repository does not govern edits to that runbook except by the pin in the issue.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.7 — Cancel a pending SWA write</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** either SWA Safe alone · **When:** during the hold/window

Either Safe can stop a bad SWA change on the matching path:

1. `cancelPending(id, op)` — queued stream operation on f02 (relayed to `f02.CancelPending`).
2. `cancelPendingWeight(op)` — queued weight write on f02.
3. `veto(taskId)` — a task still inside the SWA (half-approved, or in the SWA-internal hold).

A cancellation only preserves the status quo. Mechanism writes (the gate step via `StepWeightRecords`) cannot be cancelled: `CancelPending` refuses that operation (FIP-0118 §2.4.7 and §4.3). Record the cancellation on the task-register issue. `TODO(owners): confirm` whether that record includes a written reason.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.8 — Objection during an SWA hold</strong></summary>

The objection channel is an issue in this repository, using the community issue template, with nature "Objection to a pending SWA write". It is open to anyone during the hold.

The issue states the chain id, the queued write (`taskId` or the f02 operation), the accepted FIP (link and commit), and which of the FIP's cancel grounds is claimed: the queued write does not match the accepted FIP, the FIP is missing, or new information surfaced after acceptance (FIP-0118 §4.3). `TODO(owners): confirm` that an objection outside those grounds is not a sustained objection.

A **sustained objection** is an objection that states one of those grounds, is filed here during the hold, and is not withdrawn. It does not itself cancel the write. Either SWA Safe may cancel. Whether to cancel is that Safe's decision. `TODO(owners): confirm` that a cancellation, and a decision not to cancel, is recorded on the issue with a written reason.

The response-time commitment is 7 days, published in this section and in [§2.4.2](#242-governed-parameters). It is how quickly a Safe acts on an objection during the hold. It does not extend `SWA_TIMELOCK`.

SRA registry writes have no objection cancel. They bind when the second Safe approves (FIP-0118 §4.3). This section does not add a cancel path for them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.9 — Monitor mechanism-executed updates</strong></summary>

The w1 ramp and the quarterly gate step (`QuarterlyGateCheck` → `StepWeightRecords`) run permissionlessly. Any party may crank `QuarterlyGateCheck`. Nothing on chain schedules it. A late crank delays the stepped w2 by the same amount, and f02 burns the difference between the ceiling and the standing w2 while the delay lasts (FIP-0118 §2.2). Each quarter:

1. Confirm the queued w2 write matches the gate rule and the bound `AggregatedFPV(Q)`.
2. Note it is a scheduled write: it queues 7 days for visibility only and is not cancellable.
3. Record the crank (chain id, quarter, transaction) on the quarter's issue.
4. If a mismatch suggests compromise, escalate per §2.5, Safety and rotation playbook; the remedy will be a Safe/code replacement, not cancelling the mechanism write.

`TODO(owners):` name a primary and a backup cranker, and any deadline after the window closes. This repository does not assign one.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.2.10 — Continuous upkeep</strong></summary>

During every `SWA_TIMELOCK`, monitor the f02 queue and objections under [§2.2.8](#228--objection-during-an-swa-hold), and act within the 7-day response-time commitment published there and in [§2.4.2](#242-governed-parameters). Keep Safe rosters and internal-implementation disclosures current.

## 2.3 SRA Governance Tier — Tasks and Actions

> **How to read this subsection:** every individual action below is a collapsible dropdown. Click an action's title to expand only the one you care about. The [Orchestrator Registry](#2312-orchestrator-registry-admitted-orchestrators) sits at the bottom (2.3.12).

SRA Governance is **Tier 2**: it governs the Service Rewards Actor (SRA) — the orchestrator registry and the split within the service stream. FIP-0118 fixes its discretionary powers; registry changes require no per-change FIP except a code upgrade:

SRA Governance's discretionary powers are fixed by FIP-0118 §4.2. They are: admit or remove an Orchestrator; replace an Orchestrator's payout wallet on its public request; cooperatively rotate a Registry multisig (`ReplaceOwner`); reassign contested (payer, operator) bindings; correct or supply posted volumes during the verification window (`CorrectVolume`); audit Orchestrators on an exception basis; maintain the admitted lists that scope FPV; set the FIL pricing parameters and `REGISTRATION_CUTOFF`; and upgrade the SRA's code, the one registry change that requires a FIP.

Registry changes need both Registry Safes but need no per-change FIP (the one exception is a code upgrade). The quarterly verification runs against a public record and is deterministic.

> **Standard registry-change flow** (referenced by 2.3.1–2.3.5 and by the Safe replacement in 2.5.3):
>
> 1. Trigger and diligence (application, dispute outcome, audit finding, rotation request, or list update).
> 2. Both Registry Safes approve the relevant call. The first Safe’s transaction only records its approval (`UnanimousGovernance`); the action body runs in the second Safe’s transaction (SRA header: the second Safe MUST dry-run the calldata before approving). The second Safe signs only if a dry-run simulation of **its own** approval succeeds, and notes the simulation result on the task-register issue. On a simulated revert (wrong wallet, closed window, pending shares, etc.), either Safe `veto`s and the action is resubmitted. `TODO(owners): confirm` that a veto is recorded on the issue with a written reason. The contract does not require the reason.
> 3. The change binds when the second SRA Safe approves (no pending queue, no cancellation path). Record it in the Change Log.
> 4. Both Registry Safes can see the submitted task. The `Submitted` event carries the `taskId`, not the full content; the issue carries the content.
> 5. Record the outcome in the issue/repository, and update the [Orchestrator Registry](#2312-orchestrator-registry-admitted-orchestrators) where the change affects an Orchestrator's status.

The recomputation is deterministic: any observer running the reference indexer over the same settlement events and registry state reaches the same figure.

### Admission (Phase 1: discretionary)

An Orchestrator's application is filed as an issue in this repository. If application is approved, SRA Governance executes the admit on-chain (action 2.3.1). **Every admitted Orchestrator is recorded in the [Orchestrator Registry (2.3.12)](#2312-orchestrator-registry-admitted-orchestrators).**

Phase 1 admission is discretionary (FIP-0118 §4.3). The admission rubric is not set. `TODO(owners): confirm` that a denial is recorded on the application issue with a written rationale. `TODO(owners):` publish the rubric before the first application is decided, including any decision deadline and whether a denial can be appealed. This repository does not invent the criteria.

A uniqueness rule is fixed by the FIP:

> "Indeed, the SRA enforces that each (payer, operator) pair is bound to at most one Orchestrator, so a registration that duplicates an existing binding reverts."

For Phase 2 (subject to a future FIP): admission becomes permissionless, enabled by a standard attribution-metadata interface specified in a future FIP. The rubric and diligence apply to Phase 1 only.

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.1 — Admit an Orchestrator (AddOrchestrator)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SRA Safes · **Hold:** none · **Enforced by:** SRA · **Cancel:** not cancellable (either Safe may `veto(taskId)` only while half-approved) · **No FIP**

1. Application filed as an issue (identity/team, funding plan, declared (payer, operator) pairs and measurement rules). The issue states the chain id.
2. Resolve the payout wallet to an actor ID. It must exist, and it must not be a payment channel. f02 rejects payment-channel recipients on `SetShares` and `ReplaceAddress` (FIP-0118 §2.4.4). Record the actor code on the issue. A payment-channel wallet can still break `SubmitShares` for every Orchestrator; see §2.3.3.
3. Both Registry Safes approve `AddOrchestrator(orch, wallet)` using the task-register issue’s canonical calldata; the uniqueness rule reverts any pair already bound elsewhere.
4. Either Safe may `veto(taskId)` while the task is half-approved. Once both have approved, the admission is not cancellable.
5. Binds and applies at once: the Orchestrator may register pairs and post from the admission epoch (FIP-0118 §3.2). Record it in the issue **and add the Orchestrator to the [Orchestrator Registry (2.3.12)](#2312-orchestrator-registry-admitted-orchestrators)**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.2 — Remove an Orchestrator (RemoveOrchestrator)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SRA Safes · **Hold:** none · **Enforced by:** SRA · **Cancel:** not cancellable (either Safe may `veto(taskId)` only while half-approved) · **No FIP**

`RemoveOrchestrator` is the single sanction (FIP-0118 §3.2). It is not reversed in place. From the epoch it binds, the Orchestrator's future service-stream income is re-pointed to `f099` and burns until the next `SubmitShares`. Amounts already accrued stay claimable. The removal releases the Orchestrator's (payer, operator) bindings, and those pairs can be registered again. A new registration's back-cover reaches the release epoch only, not the span the removed Orchestrator served. Update the Orchestrator Registry to mark the entry *Removed*.

The call reverts while an ended quarter's share map is still pending. Crank `SubmitShares` first and call `RemoveOrchestrator` in the next message (FIP-0118 §3.2). An Orchestrator that expects a removal can `Claim` first. Honest Orchestrators limit that exposure by claiming often (FIP-0118, Security Considerations).

Expect other Orchestrators to race for the released pairs. A registration the dispute process finds wrongful is corrected by [§2.3.11](#2311--reassign-a-binding-reassignbinding). `TODO(owners):` any epoch window used only as a monitoring alert after a removal. This repository sets none.

A later return, where one is allowed, is a fresh `AddOrchestrator` with a fresh application. Failure to file the quarterly report forfeits re-admission for the following quarter (FIP-0118 §4.2), so a fresh application is not available in that quarter. `TODO(owners):` whether any other removal ground allows a later fresh application, and in which quarter.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.3 — Replace / rotate an Orchestrator address (ReplaceWallet)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SRA Safes · **Hold:** none · **Enforced by:** SRA · **Cancel:** not cancellable (either Safe may `veto(taskId)` only while half-approved) · **No FIP**

`ReplaceWallet` is available only on a public request from the Orchestrator recorded in this repository (FIP-0118 §3.2). No approval without that request. A replacement with no matching request is the capture the FIP calls hostile on sight.

1. The Orchestrator files an issue identifying `orch`, the new payout wallet, and the chain id. `TODO(owners):` whether that request must also carry a signature by `orch`, and which scheme. `TODO(owners): confirm` whether, until that is set, the Safes withhold approval unless the Orchestrator has confirmed the request from its published contact.
2. Resolve the new wallet to an actor ID. It must exist and must not be a payment channel (same check as §2.3.1). Record the actor code on the issue.
3. Both Registry Safes approve `ReplaceWallet(old, new)` on the issue's canonical calldata. Per FIP-0118 §3.2, the call swaps the payout wallet through an immediate `ReplaceAddress`, so f02 pays the new wallet at once. The Orchestrator identity does not change, and accrued balances are not moved. Update the payout-wallet field in the Orchestrator Registry.
4. If the `orch` identity cannot file the request, this procedure does not run. There is no `ReplaceWallet` without the public request. `TODO(owners):` any out-of-band identity check, used only toward a fresh admission or a removal review.

**Payment-channel wallet recovery.** A payout wallet that is a payment channel can pass an actor-exists check but breaks `SubmitShares` / `SetShares` for **every** Orchestrator (Rod’s devnet). `RemoveOrchestrator` also reverts while a quarter’s share map is still pending (`PendingShares`). Exit order:

1. `ReplaceWallet` to a non-payment-channel wallet, on the public request above (and re-check actor code).
2. `SubmitShares` for the pending quarter (now that every wallet in the map is admissible).
3. `RemoveOrchestrator` if the Orchestrator is being exited (only after shares are no longer pending).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.4 — Quarterly FPV verification & correction (CorrectVolume)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SRA Safes (jointly) · **Hold:** none; bounded by the verification window · **Enforced by:** SRA · **Cancel:** not cancellable

1. Recompute every admitted Orchestrator's `FPV_i(Q)`, posted or not, from public settlement events and registry state. Use the versioned reference indexer when it is published. Until then, the normative algorithm is FIP-0118 §2.2 at the commit pinned in the [README](../README.md). This recomputation is an SRA duty every quarter. It is not triggered only by a dispute (FIP-0118 §2.2 and Security Considerations).
2. Publish the recomputation on the task-register issue before either Safe approves: chain id, indexer version or the pinned FIP commit, the settlement and registry events, and the blocks covered. `TODO(owners): confirm` that neither Safe signs a `CorrectVolume` that lacks that publication. `TODO(owners):` any minimum time between publication and the first signature. This repository sets none.
3. During the verification window, both Safes jointly call `CorrectVolume(orch, Q, value)` to replace a misreport or supply a figure for a non-poster. A value neither posted nor supplied binds at zero (conservative under-count). The issue carries the canonical calldata and the expected `taskId` before the first approval. An upward correction, or a figure supplied for an Orchestrator that did not post, uses the same publication and states why the figure is the recomputed value. The FIP allows both directions. This repository does not add an approval the contract does not have. `TODO(owners):` who watches for a correction that changes whether the gate passes.
4. **One Safe can block a correction.** `CorrectVolume` needs both Registry Safes. The window check runs in the function body after approvals are stored (`ServiceRewardsActor.correctVolume`), so a second approval after the window closes reverts and the first approval stays. Aim for both approvals by day 5 of the 7-day mainnet window (scale the same fraction on calibnet). That aim is not a protocol deadline. `TODO(owners):` any earlier internal deadline.
5. **If the second approval misses the window,** the posted figure, or zero if nothing was posted, binds (FIP-0118 §2.2). The first approver `veto`s the stale task. The Safes publish a "correction blocked" note on the same issue: the Orchestrator, the recomputed figure, and that it did not bind. `TODO(owners): confirm` whether that note is a removal-review trigger for a poster whose figure was not corrected. If the bound figure passed the gate, reversing the standing w2 step takes a new FIP-backed SWA write paired with the matching `steps` adjustment (FIP-0118, Security Considerations, and §2.2.5). This repository does not pre-authorize that FIP. `TODO(owners):` a reversal template, if one is wanted before it is needed.
6. Values bind when the window closes. There is no separate cancellation of a completed correction.
7. A contested correction is appealed via the [dispute process](04-quarterly-review-and-runbook.md#442-dispute-resolution-for-contested-bindings). The outcome affects only later quarters.

FIP-0118 fixes the binding behavior:

> "Binding: whatever each value is when the window closes binds, and bound values are final for the quarter."
>
> "A value neither posted nor supplied binds as 0, so a non-poster cannot block the quarter."

<summary><strong>2.3.5 — Dispute resolution for contested bindings</strong></summary>

1. The contesting party opens an issue identifying the pair and its claim, and the chain id.
2. SRA Governance requests evidence from both parties (increasing strength: business records; client confirmation via a verifiable channel; a signed payer-wallet attestation naming the orchestrator).
3. Decide the outcome and record a written reason on the issue. A reassignment executes via [§2.3.11](#2311--reassign-a-binding-reassignbinding). A removal executes via §2.3.2. Neither is a `CorrectVolume` (§2.3.4).
4. Record the resolution in the issue.

Full procedure and evidence standards: [§4.4.2](04-quarterly-review-and-runbook.md#442-dispute-resolution-for-contested-bindings).

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.6 — Exception-based verification (removal)</strong></summary>

1. Trigger: an anomaly in public settlement data, a community report, or a contested binding. This exception audit is not the quarterly recomputation in §2.3.4, and it is not pre-clearance of deals (FIP-0118, Security Considerations).
2. Investigate: recompute FPV and examine the (payer, operator) relationships. The terms are defined in [§4.4.3](04-quarterly-review-and-runbook.md#443-verification-and-removal).
3. Decide grounds. Grounds include misreported FPV and a pattern of wrongful claims (FIP-0118, Security Considerations). Binding fraud is a named ground only once `TODO(owners)` in [§4.4.3](04-quarterly-review-and-runbook.md#443-verification-and-removal) defines it. Inactivity is a repository ground only once `TODO(owners)` in [Policy 7](03-orchestrator-operational-guidelines.md#31-policies) sets the period.
4. Act: `RemoveOrchestrator` (§2.3.2) via the standard registry-change flow. Either Safe may `veto(taskId)` only while the task is half-approved. Once both Safes have approved, removal is not cancellable.
5. Record the finding and rationale.

<summary><strong>2.3.7 — Maintain admitted lists & fee-auction parameters (SetAdmittedLists, pricing settings)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SRA Safes · **Hold:** none · **Enforced by:** SRA · **Cancel:** not cancellable (either Safe may `veto(taskId)` only while half-approved) · **No FIP**

Standard registry-change flow for the admitted-stablecoin whitelist, the admitted Filecoin Pay contract addresses, and the fee-auction pricing parameters (`MIN_LOT_FLOOR`, `MIN_LOT_ALPHA`, `PRICE_BAND`, `REGISTRATION_CUTOFF`). These are gate-consequential. The calls bind at once when the second Safe approves: each emits an event and stores nothing, and neither is held or cancellable after that approval. Either Safe can `veto(taskId)` on a half-approved task before the second approval. Never a silent edit.

Both the admitted lists and the pricing parameters, including `REGISTRATION_CUTOFF`, apply from the first epoch of the next quarter, not from the execution epoch (FIP-0118 §2.2 and §3.2). The latest event before a quarter's first epoch is the set in force for that quarter. An indexer or an Orchestrator does not apply a list or parameter change mid-quarter. For `SetAdmittedLists`, sort each address array ascending before encoding so both Safes share one `taskId` (see task-register canonical calldata). The issue states the chain id.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.8 — Upgrade the SRA's code</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SRA Safes + accepted FIP · **Hold:** `SRA_UPGRADE_HOLD`, 7 days · **Enforced by:** SRA · **Cancel:** either SRA Safe via `veto(taskId)` during the hold

The one registry change that requires a FIP (e.g., the Phase 2 permissionless-admission transition). Otherwise follows the standard flow. The upgrade issue pins the [solstice upgrade runbook](https://github.com/filecoin-project/solstice/blob/main/docs/UPGRADE.md) by commit. FIP-0118 §4.2 requires that the pending upgrade and its execution be observable on chain. `TODO(owners): confirm` whether the issue must also record an implementation bytecode hash.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.9 — Monitor mechanism-executed updates (oversight, no approval)</strong></summary>

`SubmitShares(Q)` runs permissionlessly and is not held (FPV is posted already USD-denominated; there is no separate on-chain conversion pass). Any party may crank it. Nothing on chain schedules it. A late crank delays the new share map; during the delay the previous map stands, and after a removal the removed share keeps burning until the new map is installed (FIP-0118 §2.2 and §3.2). The `RemoveOrchestrator` guard stays up until `SubmitShares` has run.

Duty: confirm `SubmitShares` has run and wrote the correct wallet-to-share map (integrity rests on the upstream verification window). It is not cancellable. Record the crank (chain id, quarter, transaction) on the quarter's issue. `TODO(owners):` name a primary and a backup cranker, and any deadline after the window closes. This repository does not assign one.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2.3.10 — Continuous upkeep</strong></summary>

Maintain and version the reference indexer; monitor anomaly reports, contested bindings, and the cancellation queue; keep Safe rosters, disclosures, and the Orchestrator Registry current. The reference indexer is not yet published. Until it is, recomputation follows the FIP text pinned in the [README](../README.md). `TODO(owners):` name an owner and a backup maintainer for the indexer, and decide whether a pinned indexer and calibnet test vectors are required before activation. This repository does not set that gate.

</details>

<summary><strong>2.3.11 — Reassign a binding (ReassignBinding)</strong></summary>

> **Requires:** both SRA Safes · **Hold:** none · **Enforced by:** SRA · **Cancel:** not cancellable once both have approved (either Safe may `veto(taskId)` only while half-approved) · **No FIP**

`ReassignBinding(pair, orch, inherit)` moves a (payer, operator) pair. `inherit` states how far the new binding reaches, and the event carries it so every verifier applies the same scope (FIP-0118 §3.2). `CancelBinding` is not this call. The bound Orchestrator releases its own pair with `CancelBinding`; see [§3.2.8](03-orchestrator-operational-guidelines.md#328--release-a-binding-cancelbinding).

Which disputes use `inherit = true` is this repository's guidance, as the FIP asks. The rule follows the FIP's own defaults. It does not add cases the FIP does not describe.

| Situation | What runs | `inherit` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| A client changes Orchestrator, and the change is not a wrongful claim | The departing Orchestrator calls `CancelBinding`. The new Orchestrator calls `RegisterPairs`. SRA Governance calls `ReassignBinding` only when the pair must move without that cooperative release. | `false`. The previous holder keeps the span it served. The new binding applies from the execution epoch. |
| A claim adjudicated wrongful, and the displaced binding's application epoch is in the current quarter or later | `ReassignBinding` to the Orchestrator that serves the client. | `true`. The new binding adopts the displaced registration's execution epoch, including back-cover and `REGISTRATION_CUTOFF` computed from that epoch. The wrongful claimant keeps nothing of that span. |
| The displaced binding already applied in an earlier quarter | `ReassignBinding` | The contract applies the move from the execution epoch, whatever argument is passed. An established Orchestrator does not lose a span it already served. |
| The pair is unbound at execution | `ReassignBinding` | Either argument. The contract applies the binding from the execution epoch. Nothing is displaced. |
| The quarter is already closed | No call reaches it | Out of reach (FIP-0118 §2.2). The resolution, like an appeal, applies prospectively. |

A closed quarter is out of reach either way. `inherit = true` is honored only when the displaced binding's application epoch falls in the current quarter or later (FIP-0118 §3.2).

The task-register issue states the chain id, the pair, the new Orchestrator, the `inherit` value, why that row of the table applies, the canonical calldata, and the expected `taskId`, before the first approval. Record the written reason on the issue.

### 2.3.12 Orchestrator Registry (admitted Orchestrators)

This is the canonical, human-readable list of Orchestrators admitted to the Solstice program. It is maintained by SRA Governance and mirrors on-chain SRA registry state — **the on-chain registry is the source of truth**; this list is a convenience view and audit trail. Entries are added and updated only through the SRA registry actions above: an Orchestrator appears on Admit (2.3.1), has its wallet updated on Replace (2.3.3), and is marked *Removed* on Remove (2.3.2).

**Initial Orchestrator at activation.** FIP-0118 seats an Orchestrator at activation and requires it to “publish a disclosure on activation, following the requirements in the governance repository set for any other Orchestrator.” That disclosure is on activation, not within 7 days of an `AddOrchestrator` admission ([§3.1, Policy 6](03-orchestrator-operational-guidelines.md#31-policies)). That Orchestrator is not admitted through an Admit action (2.3.1). On activation it publishes the same declaration file required of any other Orchestrator, and SRA Governance sets its registry row below to **Active** with admission = quarter 1 (identity and payout wallet `0x97A90f5696be5E3C8d3752C92Adac287c2b4484e`, matching `initialOrchestrator` / `initialOrchestratorWallet` in [`deployments.json`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/solstice/blob/main/deployments.json)).

The row below is chain id **314** (Filecoin mainnet). As of solstice `deployments.json` commit `b9a63a87b5adee272c16d7e507cc9c127fb34f0f`, the same address is `initialOrchestrator` and `initialOrchestratorWallet` on calibnet (chain id 314159). A mainnet action names chain id 314. The same address string is not a check that the signer is on mainnet.

Removing the sole admitted Orchestrator burns the whole service stream from the epoch the removal binds until a later `SubmitShares` with eligible volume (FIP-0118, Security Considerations). That is the launch configuration.

`TODO(owners):` before activation, publish who operates this seat, why it holds it, the custody of `0x97A9…484e`, its f1 claim keeper, and a conflict-of-interest disclosure. Whether the mainnet payout wallet should be a distinct multisig from the calibnet address is an owner decision. This repository does not change the address the activation migration seats, and it does not treat `deployments.json` as an amendment of the FIP.

**Status legend**

| Status | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Active** | Admitted and operating; can `RegisterPairs`/`PostVolume`; FPV counts toward `SplitRule` and `AggregatedFPV`. |
| **Removed** | Permanently removed; (payer, operator) bindings released for re-registration (2.3.2). |

**Admitted Orchestrators**

> **Program status:** the activation seat is recorded below; further Orchestrators appear when SRA Governance executes an `Admit` action (2.3.1). The table shows the columns each entry must carry.

| # | Orchestrator | Identity (`orch`) | Payout wallet | Status | Admitted (quarter / epoch) | Declaration | Registered (payer, operator) pairs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Initial (activation seat) | 0x97A90f5696be5E3C8d3752C92Adac287c2b4484e | 0x97A90f5696be5E3C8d3752C92Adac287c2b4484e | Active | quarter 1 | TBD (Policy 6 declaration on activation) | — |

**Per-Orchestrator entry template**

When admitting an Orchestrator, add a row to the table above and a detailed entry using this template:

```markdown
### <Orchestrator name>

- **Identity (`orch`):** <f4… / 0x… address>
- **Payout wallet:** <f4… / 0x… address> (may differ from identity)
- **Status:** Active | Removed
- **Admitted:** <quarter, epoch, tx hash>
- **Declaration issue:** #<issue number> (link)
- **Contact:** <public contact per the §3.1 responsiveness rule>
- **Recovery contact:** <a second contact, distinct from the identity key>
- **Registered (payer, operator) pairs:** <pointer to on-chain registry / list>
- **Measurement rules:** <short description or link to service-contract metadata>
- **History:** <admit / replace / remove events, each with date + tx>
```

> Field definitions follow the Orchestrator guidelines: identity and payout wallet in [§3.2](03-orchestrator-operational-guidelines.md#32-orchestrators-tasks-and-actions), the declaration file in [§3.1, Policy 6](03-orchestrator-operational-guidelines.md#31-policies), and the (payer, operator) binding rules in [§3.1, Policy 3](03-orchestrator-operational-guidelines.md#31-policies) (FIP-fixed uniqueness).

## 2.4 Parameters

### 2.4.1 Safe Addresses

Each tier consists of two organization multisigs (Safes) registered in the contract it governs. The protocol sees only the two addresses.

| Tier | Contract governed | Organization 1 Safe (address) | Organisation 2 Safe (address) | Rule (fixed by the FIP) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| SWA Governance (§2.2) | Stream Weights Actor (SWA) | 0x4d6db5600c908b3C9b9888cFef43f27F38b203e9 | 0x024a3c8CCA435db64D2dfa0f903E4823A5eBdf63 | Both approve; either alone cancels |
| SRA Governance (§2.3) | Service Rewards Actor (SRA) | 0x6c724FF811f51945d95872CF99FBd3fF63f7cFa2 | 0xFb1B58925947E52B3f75BAc3D9fB5325cfb36371 | Both approve; binds at once (not cancellable; SRA code upgrades held, either Safe may veto during the hold) |

Each organization runs a separate Safe per tier — four accounts in total — so approvals cannot be replayed across surfaces. That sentence describes four accounts. It does not say whether the same two legal entities sit in both tiers. FIP-0118 §4.2 requires one multisig per entity per tier. It permits an entity to hold one multisig in each tier, and it does not name the entities. This repository does not assert that the four Safes are or are not held by the same two organizations.

Addresses match [`filecoin-project/solstice` `deployments.json`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/solstice/blob/main/deployments.json) for Filecoin mainnet (`314`): Organization 1 = `*Owner2`, Organisation 2 = `*Owner1`. The SRA row’s cancel rule follows §2.1.2 (registry changes bind at once; only an SRA code upgrade is held and cancellable).

As of solstice `deployments.json` commit `b9a63a87b5adee272c16d7e507cc9c127fb34f0f`, the SRA proxy `0x0339f205314C8210AF7Cb075d1A96D012e7896a9` and the SWA proxy `0x66C11A9F6dfEC3c1557958cF9f575a023EB01421` are the same on mainnet (chain id 314) and calibnet (chain id 314159). The Safe owner addresses in the table above are the mainnet owners. The calibnet owners are different. Every task-register issue states the chain id. The same proxy address is not a check of which network a signer is on. `TODO(owners):` pin a Safe UI per chain id.

`TODO(owners):` publish each organization's legal name, which tier or tiers it sits in, the Safe threshold (n-of-m), signer count, custody type, and last rotation date, and disclose any organization that sits in both tiers. Readers cannot check independence, conflicts, or key hygiene until that is published. The FIP's remedy for a failed SRA tier is an SWA write from the level above (FIP-0118 §4.3).

> The approval rules are fixed by FIP-0118 §4.2, and they differ by tier:
>
> > "Both multisigs approve every discretionary action at both tiers. At the SWA tier the change is additionally held before it binds and either multisig alone can cancel it during the hold."
>
> > "At the SRA tier registry actions bind at once, each with an on-chain event and a published rationale; there is no pending queue and no cancellation path (Section 3.2)."

## 2.5 Safety and rotation playbook (both tiers)

The threat model rests on the two-Safes rule: no single Safe can make a discretionary change bind. Either SWA Safe can cancel a pending SWA change during its hold. An SRA registry change has no cancel path once both Safes have approved. Either SRA Safe can `veto(taskId)` only while the task is half-approved or, for a code upgrade, during `SRA_UPGRADE_HOLD`. FIP-0118 fixes the L1 backstop that makes even a fully compromised SWA multisig unable to bind a write early:

> "f02 itself holds every SWA write for `SWA_TIMELOCK` (7 days, Section 2.4) before applying it, so even a compromised multisig or a maliciously upgraded SWA cannot make a change bind early."

### 2.5.1 Key compromise inside a Safe (below the internal threshold)

1. The organization reports publicly in this repository.
2. Any change the Safe approved while the key was compromised is reviewed. If it is still pending, either Safe cancels it: an SWA write during its hold, or a half-approved task via `veto(taskId)`. An SRA registry change that has already bound cannot be cancelled. The review, and any cancel, is recorded on the issue. `TODO(owners): confirm` whether that record includes a written reason.
3. The organization rotates its internal membership (org-internal, immediate, no governance action) and announces the rotation here.

### 2.5.2 A whole Safe compromised (internal threshold reached by an attacker)

1. Nothing binds from one Safe alone. A hold (where one exists) starts only after both Safes approve. One Safe can only submit a task; the `Submitted` event carries the `taskId` (a hash), not the full content. The other Safe’s remedy is `veto(taskId)` on that half-approved or held task. Repeated resubmission is publicly visible; the attacker cannot bind a change silently. On the SWA side, a malicious discretionary write also lacks its required published FIP, making the objection case unambiguous.
2. **Task register (off-chain).** Pending tasks never expire on-chain (`UnanimousGovernance`), and `Submitted` names only the `taskId` hash. Before the first on-chain approval of any governance action, open an issue in this repository that records the chain id, the exact calldata, and the expected `taskId` (= `keccak256(msg.data)`). Mainnet is chain id 314. Calibnet is chain id 314159. The same proxy address on both networks is not a check that the signer is on the intended network (§2.4.1). That issue is the human-readable register entry the hash alone cannot provide. **Canonical calldata:** both Safes copy the calldata from that issue verbatim. Address lists in the payload (e.g. `SetAdmittedLists`) are sorted ascending by address before encoding — the same list in a different order is a different `msg.data` and a different task that never reaches unanimity. The second Safe also records its pre-approval dry-run result on that issue (see the standard flows in §2.2 and §2.3). `TODO(owners):` any age after which operators should veto a half-approved task. The contract does not expire it.
3. The tier is treated as frozen (halted/suspended), and frozen consequences are bounded: registry frozen means payments and `SetShares` continue; SWA frozen means discretionary changes stop while the ramp and the gate continue through the permissionless crank.
4. Exit: replace the compromised Safe address. This requires both Safes, so if the compromised Safe obstructs, the FIP backstop applies (2.5.3).

### 2.5.3 Replacing a registered Safe

Applies to either tier; the mechanics are the same on the SRA and the SWA.

**Cooperative case** (requires both Safes of that contract · hold: none · not cancellable):

1. Veto every open task on that contract first. `removeOwner` does not clear pending approvals; a freed owner bit can recycle to a future owner still carrying old approvals (`Owners.sol`). Every unanimous action shares one pending-task mapping, so this covers code upgrades, registry or gate-parameter changes and owner replacements alike; the task register above lists them. The issue records a sign-off that every open task was vetoed before the first `ReplaceOwner` approval. `TODO(owners): confirm` whether that sign-off includes a written reason for each veto.
2. Both Safes approve the replacement (`ReplaceOwner`), with the action's chain id, calldata, and `taskId` recorded in the issue before the first approval (see task register above). It binds at once when the second Safe approves.
3. Record the new Safe in [2.4.1 Safe Addresses](#241-safe-addresses) and the [Program Change Log](06-changelog.md), with the reason for the replacement; a compromise also gets a post-mortem.
4. Do the engineering items in the [owner change FAQ](https://github.com/filecoin-project/solstice/blob/main/docs/UPGRADE.md#how-do-i-handle-an-owner-change). The issue pins that runbook by commit.

**Hostile or deadlocked case**, always under a published FIP. The path depends on which tier has failed (FIP-0118 §4.3). A network upgrade is not the path for both.

- **Rogue or deadlocked SRA.** SWA Governance re-points the service stream's designated writer to a redeployed SRA (`SetDistribution`, §2.2.4). Registry state is reconstructible from public data. Until that write binds, the incumbent SRA keeps the service-stream flow. The gate keeps reading the previous SRA until an SWA code upgrade changes the wired SRA address (FIP-0118, Security Considerations). That code upgrade is a FIP and a contract upgrade. It is not a network upgrade (FIP-0118 §4.1).
- **Rogue or deadlocked SWA.** A network upgrade migrates the SWA address in f02 (FIP-0118 §4.3 and §3.1).

`TODO(owners):` whether proxy addresses hardwired in Lotus, Forest, and Venus, the question PR #17 raised, change the SRA path in FIP-0118 §4.3.

### 2.5.4 Both SWA Safes captured

FIP-0118 does not provide a fast path short of a FIP. When both SWA multisigs are captured, a hostile valid write stays queued for the full `SWA_TIMELOCK`. The backstop is an emergency network upgrade within that hold (FIP-0118, Security Considerations). This repository does not shorten that clock.

`TODO(owners):` implementer contacts for Lotus, Forest, and Venus, a public alert channel, a pre-drafted emergency FIP, and a tabletop before activation. Simultaneous compromise of both tiers has no separate procedure in the FIP beyond that emergency upgrade and, if an honest SWA write is still possible, the SRA re-point in §2.5.3.
